        "text": "Pope John Paul II, sometimes called Saint John Paul or John Paul the Great, born Karol Józef Wojtyła, was the 264th Pope of the Catholic Church from 16 October 1978 to his death in 2 April 2005. He was the second longest-serving pope in history. As a Pole, he was the first non-Italian pope in 455 years. The last non-Italian pope was Pope Adrian VI, who died in 1523. He is the first ever pope to visit the White House, and a mosque. He traveled more than any other pope before him, visiting many of the countries of the world. He is also famous for starting the annual World Youth Day. After he was beatified, his title was changed to Blessed John Paul II. John Paul II was canonized by Pope Francis on April 27, 2014 which means that the Polish Pope is now known as Saint John Paul II."

        "text":"Red Hot Chili Peppers are an American rock band. The band started in 1983 in Los Angeles, California. The state of California has been a theme in many of their songs. The members of the band are singer Anthony Kiedis, bass guitarist Flea, guitarist Josh Klinghoffer, and drummer Chad Smith. The Red Hot Chili Peppers have released eleven studio albums. Their early albums were a mix of Rock and Funk, and were not very successful. The band's membership changed several times during this period, but Kiedis and Flea have been with the band since it started. When Frusciante and Smith joined in 1989, Red Hot Chili Peppers' next album, Mother's Milk, was successful. It was the band's first album to appear on the Billboard music chart. While Red Hot Chili Peppers were on tour in 1992 after their fifth and most successful album, Blood Sugar Sex Magik, Frusciante left the band because of a drug addiction."

        "text":"Evolution is a scientific theory used by biologists. It explains how animals and plants changed over a long time, and how they have come to be the way they are. Earth is very old, about 4.5 billion years. By studying the layers of rock that make up Earth's crust, scientists can find out about its past. This kind of research is called historical geology. We know that living things have changed over time, because we can see their remains in the rocks. These remains are called 'fossils'. So we know that the animals and plants of today are different from those of long ago. And the further we go back, the more different the fossils are. How has this come about? Evolution has taken place. That evolution has taken place is a fact, because it is overwhelmingly supported by many lines of evidence. At the same time, evolutionary questions are still being actively researched by biologists. The theory of evolution is the basis of modern biology. Nothing in biology makes sense without it."
